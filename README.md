## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

We ran our experiments with PyTorch 2.3.0, CUDA 12.1, Python 3.9.19 and Ubuntu 18.04.

Relative depth estimates for this project are based on Depth-Anything-V2, which you can find [here](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2).

## üíæ Data Preparation

We mainly used the UIEB dataset. You can download the UIEB and  UIEB-Challenging dataset from [here](https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/UIEB) and pre-convert the images to.jpg format. 

As for the training of Degraded Parameters Estimation Module (DPEM), you can download the NYU-Depth-V2 dataset from [here](https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/NYUv2). The absolute depth scale of each image extracted is saved in the file *./DPEM/depth_scale.txt*.

## üì¶ Models

You can download the model weights we provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rZe1U5Sq0IrEFXv3vV6KUIIkVb5Qa4ON?usp=sharing), including:


- **DPEM**(trained on the synthetic data in the first stage)
- **DPEM_finetune** (fine-tuned at a low learning rate in the second stage)
- **DPF-Net** (for image enhancement)
- **Depth-Anything-V2** (for generating depth maps when data is loaded, you can also substitute other MDE models if you like)

## üìä Test

We recommend putting **DPF-Net.pth** and **DPEM_finetune.pth** in the *./checkpoint* folder and **depth_anything_v2_vits.pth** in *the ./Depth_Anything_V2_main* folder. You can test DPF-Net with:

```shell
python test.py \
--raw_image_path /path/to/raw_images/folder \
--load_DPF_Net /path/to/checkpoint/DPF-Net \
--load_DPEM /path/to/checkpoint/DPEM_finetune \
--depth_anything_folder /path/to/depth_anything/folder
```

Enhancement results are saved in *./out_images* (automatically created if the folder does not already exist)

## üïíTrain

You can train DPF-Net with:

```shell
python train.py \
--raw_image_path /path/to/raw_images/folder \
--load_DPEM /path/to/checkpoint/DPEM_finetune \
--depth_anything_folder /path/to/depth_anything/folder
```

The trained models will be saved in the ./checkpoint folder
